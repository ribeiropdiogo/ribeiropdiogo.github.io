Since 2022, I'm a member of the High-Assurance Software Laboratory located at the Gualtar Campus of the University of Minho, in Braga. Some of the topics I have been working with range from Security topics to Distributed Systems. I finished my Master's degree in Software Engineering at the University of Minho in 2022, and I'm currently attending the Doctorate in Informatics at the same institution.
