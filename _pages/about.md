My name is Diogo, and I am a Research Assistant at the High-Assurance Software Laboratory at the University of Minho’s Gualtar Campus. In addition to my research work, I am also an Invited Assistant at the University of Minho, where I teach courses related to cryptography, security, and informatics laboratories. My current research focuses on truth discovery and reputation systems, areas that I find both challenging and highly relevant in today's digital landscape.

I hold a Master’s degree in Informatics Engineering from the University of Minho, where I am currently pursuing my Doctorate in Informatics. My academic journey has been driven by a strong passion for technology, problem-solving, and innovation. I am always eager to deepen my knowledge and contribute to advancements in my field.

Outside of my professional and academic pursuits, I am deeply passionate about sports, particularly cycling and football, both of which I actively practice. I find that sports not only keep me physically active but also help me develop discipline, resilience, and a competitive mindset—qualities that are equally valuable in my research. In addition, I have a strong interest in motorsports and enjoy following the latest developments in the field.

I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow, whether through research, teaching, or personal projects. My curiosity and drive to learn are what keep me motivated every day.
