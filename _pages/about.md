Since 2022, I'm a Research Assistant at the High-Assurance Software Laboratory located at the Gualtar Campus of the University of Minho in Braga. Some of the topics I have been working with range from Security topics to Distributed Systems. I finished my Master's degree in Software Engineering at the University of Minho in 2022, and I'm currently attending the Doctorate in Informatics at the same institution.

My favorite hobbies range from practicing sports like football, futsal, boxing, mountain biking, and running, to activities such as traveling and exploring new places. I'm a big fan of motorsports (either on 2 or 4 wheels) and I love outdoor activities. I'm always interested in new challenges and learning new stuff. I consider myself a hard worker and a motivated person, being that the desire to learn and discover new things is what drives me.
